# Soon-to-be Noor's Portfolio

My portfolio project is a reflection of my creativity, technical skill, and unique perspective as a front end developer. I've designed every aspect of the website, from the user interface to the code, with my personal aesthetic and approach to web development in mind.

## Inspiration 

As someone who is passionate about computer science, I believe that incorporating my own unique perspective and aesthetic into my work is crucial. While traditional stereotypes of computer science might prioritize a masculine and utilitarian aesthetic, I see value in adding elements of femininity to my projects. This can include everything from the design of user interfaces to the code itself.

While some might argue that incorporating feminine aesthetics is not "serious" or "professional" enough for the field of computer science, I believe that this attitude is outdated and limiting. By embracing a more diverse range of aesthetics and design elements, we can create projects that are not only visually engaging, but also more representative of the diverse individuals who use them.
