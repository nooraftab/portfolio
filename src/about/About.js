          ‚ÄúMy prerogative is always like, first things first: it has to be cute.
          A part of what makes everything I build in computer science me is that
          it looks like me; it‚Äôs going to have my aesthetic and just kind of the
          way that I look at things. Because I know I come to computer science
          with an interesting and different perspective, everything I build is
          not going to lose its femininity because of the fact that it‚Äôs
          STEM-related.‚Äù
