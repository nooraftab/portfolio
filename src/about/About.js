          ‚ÄúMy prerogative is always like, first things first: it has to be cute.
          A part of what makes everything I build in computer science me is that
          it looks like me; it‚Äôs going to have my aesthetic and just kind of the
          way that I look at things. Because I know I come to computer science
          with an interesting and different perspective, everything I build is
          not going to lose its femininity because of the fact that it‚Äôs
          STEM-related.‚Äù

        <p>ü§ç I believe that design starts with people.</p>
        <p>
          As a developer with a background in design, I aim to have a
          human-centered approach. If there is anything I have learned, with our
          power as developers who are crafting people's experiences, we cannot
          afford not to be human-centric.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          I ultimately hope to put out work positively impacting people's lives
          and continue to be mindful of my designs.
