          ‚ÄúMy prerogative is always like, first things first: it has to be cute.
          A part of what makes everything I build in computer science me is that
          it looks like me; it‚Äôs going to have my aesthetic and just kind of the
          way that I look at things. Because I know I come to computer science
          with an interesting and different perspective, everything I build is
          not going to lose its femininity because of the fact that it‚Äôs
          STEM-related.‚Äù

        <p>
          As a developer with a background in design, I aim to have a
          human-centered approach. If there is anything I have learned, with our
          power as developers who are crafting people's experiences, we cannot
          afford not to be human-centric.{" "}

          In addition to my passion for coding and front end development, I also
          love exploring my creativity in other areas of life. Whether I'm
          brainstorming design concepts for a new project, experimenting with a
          new recipe in the kitchen, or getting lost in a good book, I find that
          immersing myself in creative pursuits helps to keep my mind fresh and
          inspired.

          In my free time, I'm also passionate about staying up-to-date on the
          latest trends and developments in design and technology. I enjoy
          reading articles and blog posts, watching videos, and attending
          conferences and meetups to learn from other professionals in the
          field. This constant learning and growth helps me to stay inspired and
          motivated, and allows me to bring fresh perspectives and ideas to my
          work as a front end developer.

          <p className="about-cafe-hopping">
            One of my favorite ways to unwind and let my creativity flow is by
            caf√© hopping around town. I love trying out different coffee shops
            and tea houses, soaking in the unique ambiance and enjoying a
            delicious beverage while I work on personal projects or simply
            people-watch. Whether I'm sipping a hot Caramel Macchiato or an iced
            Matcha Latte, I find that a change of scenery and a good drink can
            do wonders for my creativity and productivity.
